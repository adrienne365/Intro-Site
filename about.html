                <p class="frontend">I have always appreciated the way that <strong>form</strong> and <strong>function</strong> can complement one
                    another, and the relationship between <strong>design</strong> and <strong>functionaity</strong> in apps and
                    online feels similar. Working on the front end also incorporates my personal enjoyment and strengths of
                    <strong>editing</strong> and <strong>curating</strong> a design experience.

                <p class="winenerd">I started working in restaurants when I was 14. After high school I moved to Chicago, where
                a job as a retail cheesemonger introduced me to wine, which I continued to study as I moved into fine dining
                service. I worked my first harvest in 2016 and have been making wine in Northern Michigan since 2019. I love
                the way that winemaking blends agriculture and chemistry, and the way that wine demonstrates the full and
                complicated relationship of an ecosystem and its biology.<br>Also, it's delicious.

                <p class="pups"> I have two adopted fur babies and I love them very dearly.<br>
                    I got Hank, right, in 2021, and he has made me fall in love with pitbull mixes.<br>
                    He's three, loves to go running with me, and his favorite places to be are on
                    your lap with a toy in his mouth and napping with you.<br>
                    Daisy has been with me since February of 2023. She is chronologically four and a half
                    but very much still a puppy.<br>
                    She is a jumping bean who is full of kisses, and don't you dare try to sleep in later than she does.
