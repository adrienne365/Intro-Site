        <p>I have always appreciated the way that <strong>form</strong> and <strong>function</strong> can complement one
            another, and the relationship between <strong>design</strong> and <strong>functionaity</strong> in apps and
            online feels similar. Working on the front end also incorporates my personal enjoyment and strengths of
            <strong>editing</strong> and <strong>curating</strong> a design experience.

        <p class="winenerd">I started working in restaurants when I was 14. After high school I moved to Chicago, where
            a job as a retail cheesemonger introduced me to wine, which I continued to study as I moved into fine dining
            service. I worked my first harvest in 2016 and have been making wine in Northern Michigan since 2019. I love
            the way that winemaking blends agriculture and chemistry, and the way that wine demonstrates the full and
            complicated relationship of an ecosystem and its biology.<br>Also, it's delicious.</p>
